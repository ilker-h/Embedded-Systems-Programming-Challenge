# Embedded Systems Programming Challenge

This is a programming challenge that was given for my "Embedded Systems" course. I had one partner. It was written in C using the Renesas eÂ² studio IDE on the Renesas Synergy FPGA Board.

The game is a competition between the Green Team and the Amber Team, as they must each click their respective button in order to turn off their respective LED on time in order to gain a point. The objective is to see who can reach 10 points the fastest.

We received an "A+" on the project.
